## The seminarpaper
All repositories within this GitHub organization are modules developed for my seminar paper "Development of an authoring system for interactive fiction". The paper was written for my high school in 2022 and had the goal to improve the student's skills on scientific work.

You can read the original German version as well as an Google-translated one online: <br>

## The authoring system
The authoring system that has been developed offers a user friendly UI client called "MysteryMaker" to create interactive fiction. For that it uses json files and a custom framework for the game engine [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot). Additionally, its theming system allows a lot of freedom not only on modifing the appearance but also the interactions.
